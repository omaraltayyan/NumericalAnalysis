This is the numerical analysis project for students and the FITE of Damascus university

This project is written in C#, and uses the simple windows forms UI.

here's how to setup your work:

1 - you need to clone this repository by using
      git clone "https://github.com/omaraltayyan/NumericalAnalysis/"

2 - for each feature that you create, or one or more bugs that you wanna fix, you need to create a branch
a branch is like a special personal space for you to edit the code and UI as much as you like without effecting the original project.

use this command to create a branch:
git branch -d <branch name>

example: git branch -d "Hermit method"

3 - every now and then, do a commit, a commit applies your changes to your repositry and makes your changes ready to be uploaded to the cloud

here's how to do a commit:
git commit -m"a description of changes"

4 - you can apply you changes to the online cloud by using push command:

git push -u origin <your branch name>

5 - you can stay up to date with the changes to the project by using pull
    git pull
    

Note: this readme needs editing, and review.
